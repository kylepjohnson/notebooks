       "\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What\\nI disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to\\nruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is\\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.\\n\""
